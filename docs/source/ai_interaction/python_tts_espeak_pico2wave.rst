1. TTS with Espeak and Pico2Wave
=================================================

In this lesson, we'll use two built-in text-to-speech (TTS) engines on Raspberry Pi ‚Äî **Espeak** and **Pico2Wave** ‚Äî to make the Fusion HAT+ talk.  

These two engines are both simple and run offline, but they sound quite different:

* **Espeak**: very lightweight and fast, but the voice is robotic. You can adjust speed, pitch, and volume.  
* **Pico2Wave**: produces a smoother and more natural voice than Espeak, but has fewer options to configure.  

You'll hear the difference in **voice quality** and **features**.  

----

1. Testing Espeak
--------------------

Espeak is a lightweight TTS engine included in Raspberry Pi OS.  
Its voice sounds robotic, but it is highly configurable: you can adjust volume, pitch, speed, and more.  

**Run the program**

  .. code-block:: bash
  
      cd ~/fusion-hat/examples
      sudo python3 tts_espeak.py

  * You should hear the Fusion HAT+ say: ‚ÄúHello! I'm Espeak TTS.‚Äù
  * Try changing the tuning parameters in the code to experiment with how ``amp``, ``speed``, ``gap``, and ``pitch`` affect the sound.

**Code**

.. code-block:: python
  
  from fusion_hat.tts import Espeak

  # Create Espeak TTS instance
  tts = Espeak()

  # Optional voice tuning
  tts.set_amp(100)    # 0 to 200
  tts.set_speed(150)  # 80 to 260
  tts.set_gap(1)      # 0 to 200
  tts.set_pitch(80)   # 0 to 99

  tts.say("Hello! I‚Äôm Espeak TTS.")

**Code explanation:**

* ``tts.set_amp()`` ‚Äî Controls the volume (0‚Äì200).  
* ``tts.set_speed()`` ‚Äî Adjusts the speaking speed (80‚Äì260).  
* ``tts.set_gap()`` ‚Äî Sets the word gap (0‚Äì200).  
* ``tts.set_pitch()`` ‚Äî Sets the pitch (0‚Äì99).  
* ``tts.say()`` ‚Äî Converts text to speech and plays it.

üí° **Tip:** Try increasing the pitch and speed to make the robot sound cheerful, or lowering them to make it sound serious.

2. Testing Pico2Wave
---------------------

Pico2Wave produces a **more natural and human-like voice** compared to Espeak.  
It‚Äôs very easy to use, but less flexible ‚Äî you can only **change the language**, not the pitch, speed, or volume.  
This makes Pico2Wave a great choice when you want clear and smooth speech without too much configuration.

**Run the program**

  .. code-block:: bash
  
      cd ~/fusion-hat/examples
      sudo python3 tts_pico2wave.py

* You should hear the Fusion HAT+ say: ‚ÄúHello! I'm Pico2Wave TTS.‚Äù  
* Try changing the language (for example, ``es-ES`` for Spanish) and listen to how the voice changes.  

**Code**

.. code-block:: python

  from fusion_hat.tts import Pico2Wave

  # Create Pico2Wave TTS instance
  tts = Pico2Wave()

  # Set the language
  tts.set_lang('en-US')  # en-US, en-GB, de-DE, es-ES, fr-FR, it-IT
  
  # Quick hello (sanity check)
  tts.say("Hello! I'm Pico2Wave TTS.")

**Code explanation:**

* ``tts.set_lang()`` ‚Äî Sets the output language for speech synthesis.

  - ``en-US`` (default)
  - ``en-GB``
  - ``de-DE``
  - ``es-ES``
  - ``fr-FR``
  - ``it-IT``

* ``tts.say()`` ‚Äî Converts the text to speech and plays it immediately.  


----

Troubleshooting
-------------------

* **No sound when running Espeak or Pico2Wave**

  * Check that your speakers/headphones are connected and volume is not muted.  
  * Run a quick test in terminal:

    .. code-block:: bash

       espeak "Hello world"
       pico2wave -w test.wav "Hello world" && aplay test.wav

  If you hear nothing, the issue is with audio output, not your Python code.

* **Espeak voice sounds too fast or too robotic**

  * Try adjusting the parameters in your code:

    .. code-block:: python

       tts.set_speed(120)   # slower
       tts.set_pitch(60)    # different pitch

* **Permission denied when running code**

  * Try running with ``sudo``:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo python3 test_tts_espeak.py
