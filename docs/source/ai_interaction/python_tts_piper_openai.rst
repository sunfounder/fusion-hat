2. TTS with Piper and OpenAI
========================================================

In the previous lesson, we explored **Espeak** and **Pico2Wave**, two simple offline TTS engines on Raspberry Pi.  
Now, let‚Äôs take a big step forward and try two **more advanced TTS options** that offer **higher voice quality** and more flexibility:

* **Piper** ‚Äî a fast, neural network‚Äìbased TTS engine that runs **completely offline** on Raspberry Pi.  
* **OpenAI TTS** ‚Äî an online service that provides **very natural and human-like voices**, perfect for expressive speech.

These engines will make your Fusion HAT+ sound more realistic and lifelike. üöÄ

1. Testing Piper
------------------

Piper is an **offline neural TTS engine**, meaning you don‚Äôt need an internet connection once the model is installed.  
It supports multiple **languages** and **voices**, making it a powerful option for embedded speech.

**Run the program**

  .. code-block:: bash
  
      cd ~/fusion-hat/examples
      sudo python3 test_tts_piper.py

* The first time you run it, the selected **voice model** will be downloaded automatically.  
* You should then hear the Fusion HAT+ say: ``Hello! I'm Piper TTS.``  
* You can switch voices or languages by calling ``set_model()`` with a different model name.

**Code**

.. code-block:: python

  from fusion_hat.tts import Piper

  tts = Piper()

  # List supported languages
  print(tts.available_countrys())

  # List models for English (en_us)
  print(tts.available_models('en_us'))

  # Set a voice model (auto-download if not already present)
  tts.set_model("en_US-amy-low")

  # Say something
  tts.say("Hello! I'm Piper TTS.")

**Code explanation:**

* ``available_countrys()`` ‚Äî Lists all supported languages.  
* ``available_models()`` ‚Äî Lists available models for a specific language.  
* ``set_model()`` ‚Äî Sets the voice model. If the model isn‚Äôt installed, it will download automatically.  
* ``say()`` ‚Äî Converts text to speech and plays it immediately.

üí° **Tip:** Try different models to compare speed, clarity, and accents. Some models are lighter (faster), while others have higher fidelity.

2. Testing OpenAI TTS
-------------------------------

**Get and save your API Key**

#. Go to |link_openai_platform| and log in. On the **API keys** page, click **Create new secret key**.

   .. image:: img/llm_openai_create.png

#. Fill in the details (Owner, Name, Project, and permissions if needed), then click **Create secret key**.

   .. image:: img/llm_openai_create_confirm.png

#. Once the key is created, copy it right away ‚Äî you won't be able to see it again. If you lose it, you must generate a new one.

   .. image:: img/llm_openai_copy.png

#. In your project folder (for example: ``/``), create a file called ``secret.py``:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd ~/fusion-hat/examples
       sudo nano secret.py

#. Paste your key into the file like this:

   .. code-block:: python

       # secret.py
       # Store secrets here. Never commit this file to Git.
       OPENAI_API_KEY = "sk-xxx"

**Run the program**

.. code-block:: bash
  
  cd ~/fusion-hat/examples
  sudo python3 tts_openai.py

* The program will connect to OpenAI‚Äôs TTS service, and the Fusion HAT+ will speak using **natural, expressive voice output**.  
* You can change **voice styles** and add **instructions** to control tone and expression (e.g., sad, dramatic, playful).  
* This makes OpenAI TTS ideal for interactive robots, storytelling, or educational assistants.


**Code**

.. code-block:: python

  from fusion_hat.tts import OpenAI_TTS
  from secret import OPENAI_API_KEY

  # Export your OpenAI_API_KEY before running the script
  # export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-xxxxxx"

  tts = OpenAI_TTS(api_key=OPENAI_API_KEY)
  # tts.set_model('tts-1')
  tts.set_voice('alloy')
  tts.set_model('gpt-4o-mini-tts')

  msg = "Hello! I'm OpenAI TTS."
  print(f"Say: {msg}")
  tts.say(msg)

  msg = "with instructions, I can say word sadly"
  instructions = "say it sadly"
  print(f"Say: {msg}, with instructions: '{instructions}'")
  tts.say(msg, instructions=instructions)

  msg = "or say something dramaticly."
  instructions = "say it dramaticly"
  print(f"Say: {msg}, with instructions: '{instructions}'")
  tts.say(msg, instructions=instructions)


**Code explanation:**

* ``OpenAI_TTS()`` ‚Äî Initializes the OpenAI TTS engine using your API key.  
* ``set_model()`` ‚Äî Selects the TTS model (e.g., ``gpt-4o-mini-tts``).  
* ``set_voice()`` ‚Äî Chooses a specific voice (e.g., ``alloy``).  
* ``say(text)`` ‚Äî Converts the text to speech and plays it.  
* ``say(text, instructions=...)`` ‚Äî Adds **expressive tone instructions**, allowing you to control the style of speech dynamically.

**Example:** 

- ‚Äúsay it sadly‚Äù ‚Üí soft, emotional tone  
- ‚Äúsay it dramatically‚Äù ‚Üí bold and expressive delivery  
- ‚Äúsay it excitedly‚Äù ‚Üí enthusiastic tone

----

Troubleshooting
-------------------

* **No module named 'secret'**

  This means ``secret.py`` is not in the same folder as your Python file.
  Move ``secret.py`` into the same directory where you run the script, e.g.:

  .. code-block:: bash

     ls ~/
     # Make sure you see both: secret.py and your .py file

* **OpenAI: Invalid API key / 401**

  * Check that you pasted the full key (starts with ``sk-``) and there are no extra spaces/newlines.
  * Ensure your code imports it correctly:

    .. code-block:: python

       from secret import OPENAI_API_KEY

  * Confirm network access on your Pi (try ``ping api.openai.com``).  

* **OpenAI: Quota exceeded / billing error**

  * You may need to add billing or increase quota in the OpenAI dashboard.
  * Try again after resolving the account/billing issue.

* **Piper: tts.say() runs but no sound**

  * Make sure a voice model is actually present:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ls ~/.local/share/piper/voices

  * Confirm your model name matches exactly in code:

    .. code-block:: python

       tts.set_model("en_US-amy-low")

  * Check the audio output device/volume on your Pi (``alsamixer``), and that speakers are connected and powered.

* **ALSA / sound device errors (e.g., ‚ÄúAudio device busy‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo such file or directory‚Äù)**

  * Close other programs using audio.
  * Reboot the Pi if the device stays busy.
  * For HDMI vs. headphone jack output, select the correct device in Raspberry Pi OS audio settings.

* **Permission denied when running Python**

  * Try with ``sudo`` if your environment requires it:

    .. code-block:: bash

       sudo python3 tts_piper.py
