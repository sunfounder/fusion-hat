Compatibility and Power Notes
------------------------------------------------------------

The **Fusion HAT+** supports a wide range of commonly used servos and DC motors, including:

* **Micro servos:** SG90, MG90S
* **Standard servos:** MG996R, DS3218
* **SunFounder custom servos**
* **Low-current DC motors:** 130 series, N20 series
* **SunFounder custom DC motors** with **XH2.54 2-pin connectors**

**Servo Power (PWM Interface)**

The PWM interface provides up to **5V/5A** maximum output, which is shared with the Raspberry Pi.

* When connecting multiple servos, carefully account for their current draw.
* If the total servo current exceeds 5A, use an **external power supply (BEC)** to avoid overload and ensure stable operation.

**DC Motor Power**

DC motors are powered **directly from the onboard batteries (6â€“8.4V)**.

* Each motor channel supports up to **1.8A maximum current**.
* Do **not** connect motors with higher current requirements, as this may damage the motor driver chip.
