.. **Example:**

.. Read Channel 0 ADC value:

.. .. code-block:: python

..     from smbus import SMBus
..     bus = SMBus(1)

..     # read 16 bits (2 bytes) data from register 0x10 and 0x11 
..     val = bus.read_i2c_block_data(0x17, 0x10, 2)
..     msb = val[0]
..     lsb = val[1]
..     value = (msb << 8) | lsb


PWM
-----------------------

Frequency and Period Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PWM frequency is determined by the period value (ARR) and the prescaler (PSC). The principle is that the microcontrollerâ€™s internal clock runs at 72 MHz. Through prescaling, the clock is divided to obtain a frequency Fp, which is then further divided by the period count to get the PWM output frequency F. Therefore,  

.. code-block::

    F = 72,000,000 / (PSC + 1) / (ARR + 1)

In general, by specifying the desired frequency and period, you can calculate the required prescaler.  
For example, to drive a servo motor, you need a 50 Hz frequency and a desired resolution of 12 bits (i.e., a period of 2Â¹Â² = 4096). The prescaler PSC can be calculated as:  

.. code-block::

    PSC = 72,000,000 / F / (ARR + 1) - 1  
    = 72,000,000 / 50 / (4095 + 1) - 1  
    = 350.5625  
    â‰ˆ 351  

Since PSC must be an integer, it is approximated to 351. Therefore, by setting PSC = 351 and ARR = 4096, you get an actual PWM frequency of:  

.. code-block::

    72,000,000 / 352 / 4096 = 49.937 Hz â‰ˆ 50 Hz.  

By default, the PWM prescaler (PSC) and period (ARR) are set to 351 and 4095, respectively, resulting in a default frequency of approximately 50 Hz.

The pulse width corresponds to the duty cycle value within the period.  
For example, with the configuration above where the period (ARR) is 4096, setting the pulse width (CCR) to 2048 yields a 50% PWM output.  

.. code-block::

    Duty Cycle = CCR / (ARR + 1)

Pulse width
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To control the channel pulse width is rather simple, just write the value to the register.

**But** what is the value? If you want to set the PWM to 50% pulse width, you need to know
exactly what the period is. Base on the above calculation, if you set the period to 4095,
then set pulse value to 2048 is about 50% pulse width.
