.. _fh_pin_v0_adc:

ADC
-------

.. image:: img/adcfh_pin_v0.png

The Fusion HAT+ features four sets of 3 Pin ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) pins, each spaced 2.54mm apart. These pins operate at a 3.3V power supply. The ADC function, offering 12-bit precision, is facilitated by an onboard microcontroller. Detailed instructions for reading ADC values are provided in the :ref:`on_board_mcu` section.

.. image:: img/btradc_fh_v0.png

Also, ADC channel A4 is connected to the battery through a voltage divider using resistors, 
which will be used to measure the battery voltage to estimate the approximate battery charge.

The voltage divider ratio is 200K/100K, so:

* A4 voltage (Va4) = value_A4 / 4095.0 * 3.3
* Battery voltage (Vbat) = Va4*3
* Battery voltage (Vbat) = value_A4 / 4095.0 * 3.3 * 3

.. _fh_pin_v0_pwm:

PWM
--------

.. image:: img/pwmfh_pin_v0.png

Fusion HAT+ has 4 sets of 3 Pin PWM pins, each spaced 2.54mm apart, and the power supply is 5V.
The method of using the PWM is described in detail in :ref:`on_board_mcu`.

.. note:: PWM4 ~ 11 channels are used for motor drive.

.. _fh_pin_v0_i2c:

I2C
----------

.. image:: img/i2cfh_pin_v0.png

The Fusion HAT+ has two I2C interfaces. One is the P2.54 4-pin interface, and the other is the SH1.0 4-pin interface, which is compatible with QWIIC and STEMMA QT. 
These I2C interfaces are connected to the Raspberry Pi's I2C interface via GPIO2 (SDA) and GPIO3 (SCL). 
The board also features an :ref:`on_board_mcu`, and the two signal lines have 10K pull-up resistors.

.. _fh_pin_v0_spi:

SPI
---------

.. image:: img/spifh_pin_v0.png

The SPI interface of the Fusion HAT+ is a 7-pin P2.54 interface. 
It connects to the SPI interface of the Raspberry Pi and includes an additional I/O pin that can be used for purposes such as interrupts or resets.

----------

.. image:: img/uartfh_pin_v0.png

The UART interface of the Fusion HAT+ is a 4-pin P2.54 interface. 
It connects to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO14 (TXD) and GPIO15 (RXD) pins.



.. _fh_pin_v0_ws2812:

WS2812 Port
---------------

.. image:: img/ws2812fh_pin_v0.png

The Fusion HAT+ comes with 1 WS2812 port (ZH1.5 3 Pin), which can be used to control 1 WS2812 LED strip.

This Pin is shared with SPI MOSI, so it can not be used as SPI MOSI at the same time.


.. _fh_pin_v0_button:

User Button & LED
------------------------

.. image:: img/btn_led_fh_v0.png

The Fusion HAT+ comes with 1 LED and 1 button which are connected to and controlled by the I2C chip.


.. _fh_pin_v0_speaker:

Speaker and MIC
----------------------------

.. image:: img/speaker_fh_v0.png


The Fusion HAT+ is equipped with onboard I2S audio output/input, along with a 2030 audio chamber speaker, providing a mono sound output. The onboard microphone can be used to receive audio signals.

      - GPIO21
    * - Aduio IN (MIC)
      - GPIO20


If you intend to repurpose the GPIO pins without using the audio functionality, you can simply disconnect the integrated speaker and microphone via a switch. It is crucial to ensure that this disconnection is performed only when the audio components are inactive. Furthermore, you should never manipulate the WS and SCLK pins while any audio component is active.

.. _fh_pin_v0_motor:

Motor Port
-----------------

The motor driver of the Fusion HAT+ supports 4 channels and can be controlled using 8 PWM signals for direction and speed control.

Power Button & PWR Indicator
------------------------------


.. image:: img/pwr_fh_v0.png

Pressing the power button once will turn on the Raspberry Pi, and the PWR indicator will light up.
Holding the power button for 2 seconds sends a shutdown signal to the Raspberry Pi. If it is properly configured, the Raspberry Pi will shut down and the PWR indicator will turn off.
Holding the power button for 5 seconds forces a shutdown, and the PWR indicator will turn off immediately.

Additionally, the Fusion HAT+ features a :ref:`safe_shutdown` mechanism. It performs a software shutdown by reading the microcontroller‚Äôs register status via I2C.
To enable this feature, you need to configure the Raspberry Pi's shutdown signal pin and run the corresponding code on the Raspberry Pi.


.. _battery_indicator:

Battery Level Indicator
------------------------------


.. image:: img/btr_fh_v0.png

The battery level indicator on the Fusion HAT+ monitors the battery voltage using a voltage divider method and serves as a reference for estimating the battery level. 
The relationship between the LED and voltage is as follows:

.. list-table:: Battery Level
    :widths: 50 50
    :header-rows: 1

    * - LED Battery
      - Total Voltage
    * - 2 LEDs on
      - Greater than 7.4V
    * - 1 LED on
      - Greater than 6.5V
    * - Both LEDs off
      - Less than 6.5V

When any one of the batteries reaches or exceeds 4.1V while the others are below that threshold, 
the charging current of that specific battery will be reduced.



.. _servo_zeroing_btn:

Servo Zeroing Button
-----------------------

.. image:: img/btn_servo_zeroing_fh_v0.png

The servo zeroing button is used to calibrate the servo's zero position. 
When you press the button twice, all the PWM signals will be set to 1500us pulse, 20000us period. That is, the servo will be in the middle position. You should secure the servo arm to the servo in this state.

Press the button twice again, all the PWM signals will be set to 0 pulse.
